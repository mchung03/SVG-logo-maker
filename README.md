# SVG-logo-maker

## Description

The SVG logo maker creates a logo based on the user's input of a shape, fill color, text, and text color. It solves the problem of having to create logos in an editor and generates it in less than a minute. I learned to use SVG, node.js, and classes with elemenets and methods.

## Installation

- node.js is needed for the program to run (https://nodejs.org/en)
- In order to view the SVG file, you also need the SVG preview extension on VS code.

## Usage

![Prompt](./images/1.PNG)
First, type in "node index.js" to get prompted with the questions from the inquirer npm

![Select shape](./images/shape_prompt.PNG)
The shape question is presented as a list so that the user will select one option.

![Generated SVG](./images/generated.PNG)
This is the resulting image that was generated by the user input in the terminal.

![Prompt code](./images/prompt.PNG)

This code prompts the user with the 4 questions and then uses those answers to generate a shape, using the corresponding classes. Then, fs is used to write a file under the examples folder. When all is complete, "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line.

![Shape Class](./images/shape.PNG)
The classes Square, Triangle, and Circle are, in a way, subclasses of the class Shape. They render and return a line of code that will be put into the SVG class.

![Text Class](./images/text.PNG)
The text class and render method works in a similar way to the shape that the text tag is returned into the SVG class. 

![SVG Class](./images/SVG.PNG)

The SVG class is used to create a variable called newSVG that uses the render method to take that data to write in the file, hw.svg.
