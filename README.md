# SVG-logo-maker

## Description

The SVG logo maker creates a logo based on the user's input of a shape, fill color, text, and text color. It solves the problem of having to create logos in an editor and generates it in less than a minute. I learned to use SVG, node.js, and classes with elemenets and methods.
